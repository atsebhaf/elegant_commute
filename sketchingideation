            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>IDEA 1: Calling for rides</h3>
            <img src="static/images/sketch1.png" class="center"/>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>In the first idea, a user places a phone call to a centralised operator requesting for a ride from one point to another (X to Y).</p>
                <p>When the operator receives the call, he/she checks for a car operating in the zone where the user called and adds the user to the passenger list of that car.</p>
                <p>The operator then waits for any other user to request for a similar ride.</p>
                <p>When enough users call requesting for a ride from point X to Y, a taxi is sent to pick them up and the users get to share the cost of the trip with a small commission going to the operator.</p>
            
                <br>
            <h3>Critique:</h3>

            <p>The passengers are not aware of how long it will take before the car is dispatched. In the event that a small vehicle is dispatched, the passengers enjoy a fast commute due to fewer pickups and drops.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, a larger vehicle means more pick ups and drop off resulting to longer commute time. The passengers enjoy subsidised fare rates, which are lower than paying for a taxi.</p>
                
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>IDEA 2: Broadcasting Rides</h3>
            <img src="static/images/sketch2.png" class="center"/>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>An operator publishes a list of rides requested by users and available seats in each ride through a website.</p>
            <p>If a user requires a ride that is not included in the published list, they call the operator and request for a ride.</p>
            <p>When a user finds a ride that they wish to be part of, they call the operator and request to be booked for that ride.</p>
            <p>Once the car for a particular ride has all its seats booked, the car is dispatched to go and fetch the passengers from one location (chosen by person who made first call).</p>
            <p>Passengers are then dropped at their destination and pay before leaving the vehicle.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Critique:</h3>
            <p>Unlike idea 1, here the unique requests made by passengers are published and other passengers who wish to join that trip can request for it.</p>
            <p>Picking up all passengers from one location reduces the pick-up times hence reducing time for entire trip.</p>
            <p>Using voice calls to request for rides is very time consuming and some calls may end up not being answered especially during peak hours (morning and evening).</p>


            <br>
            <br>
            <h3> IDEA 3: Car Pooling</h3>
            <img src="static/images/sketch3.png" class="center"/>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>A few minutes before departing, a car owner requests for a list of all passengers who happen to happen to be taking the same route he/she will be driving.</p>
            <p>The operator checks for all requests made for that route and sends the names to the car owner.</p>
            <p>The car owner selects passengers that can be accommodated in his/her car from the list and notifies the operator.</p>
            <p>The operator removes the names of selected passengers and updates the list of requested rides. </p>
            <p>The car owner goes ahead and picks the selected passengers and starts his journey, only this time sharing the seats with other passengers at a fee.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Critique:</h3>
            <p>Users enjoy the privilege of being picked up from their locations.</p>
            <p>The driver reduces their transport costs and, in some cases, makes profit.</p>
            <p>Depending on laws, the driver may have to change the licence of their car from private to commercial so that they are allowed to make profits while commuting.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3> IDEA 4: Rendezvous</h3>
            <img src="static/images/sketch4.png" class="center"/>

            <p>An operator publishes routes to be taken during different times of the day.</p>
            <p>Users pick a route which they wish to travel to and specify a pick up location that is close to the route.</p>
            <p>When the vehicle begins its trip, it goes along the route picking up passengers from the specified locations.</p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Critique:</h3>
            <p>Users are able to plan their departure time using the published route times.</p>
            <p>Users who wish to be picked up more than 1 kilometre from the route may feel disadvantaged.</p>
            <p>The entire commute time is likely to increase because the vehicle has to make pick-ups for dispersed locations.</p>
